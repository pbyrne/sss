Feature: SSS performs the supplied command

  As a user
  I want to perform an SCM command

  # TODO figure out how to get this to not fail because the command takes longer than 3 seconds to update everything
  # Scenario: with a parameter
  #   When I run `sss up`
  #   Then SSS performs 'up'
  #   And the exit status should be 0

  # Scenario: with another parameter
  #   When I run `sss st`
  #   Then SSS performs 'st'
  #   And the exit status should be 0

  # Scenario: with multiple parameters
  #   When I run `sss foo bar`
  #   Then SSS performs 'foo'
  #   And the exit status should be 0
